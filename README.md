# React-App-Mentoring-Program

The idea is to create a single page application which will allow users to search the Netflix Roulette database.

There will be two pages: main page with search and a page with a particular film.

API

Interface:

0. Empty results state
1. Search field - enter button should works as well
2. Search filter - by default 'title' is selected, click to switch
3. Search button
4. Results count
5. Results filter - 'release date' is selected by default. Click to switch
6. Results body - All found items, without pagination
7. Item image - URL for the image you will get from the server
8. Item release date
9. Item genre
10. Item title
11. Film cover image
12. Film title
13. Film rating
14. Search button - returns user to the main page with search
15. Film duration and release year
16. Description
17. Director and cast list
18. Films by the same director

Task 1: Setting up the Environment

For this task you will need to setup a simple NodeJS server to implement server-side rendering. We recommend using Express.

Please install Webpack and setup Babel for your application. Try to make your configuration simple as for a small SPA.

You will also need to install React, Redux, React-Redux, React-Router, Jest and Redux Form.

Task 2: Create the HTML Layout with React components for both pages

You should only layout these pages using JSX. They will be used in future tasks.

Try to use all of the React composition power when performing the task: decompose components into small reusable parts.
